# Welcome to MadUI

Beautifully designed components that you can copy and paste into your apps. Accessible. Customizable. Open Source.

**This is not a component library.** It's a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your apps.

**What does that mean?**

You are not installing a dependency. You are not importing components from a package. You are copying and pasting the code into your project and customizing it to your needs. **You own the code.**

Use this to build your own component library.

## About MadUI

MadUI provides production-ready components built with modern web technologies. Each component is carefully crafted with accessibility in mind, using Radix UI primitives and styled with Tailwind CSS.

### Key Features

- **Copy & Paste**: No npm packages to install. Just copy the code you need.
- **Accessible**: Built on Radix UI with full keyboard navigation and screen reader support.
- **Customizable**: Built with Tailwind CSS. Easy to customize and extend.
- **TypeScript**: Full TypeScript support out of the box.
- **Dark Mode**: All components support dark mode by default.
- **CLI Tool**: Quickly add components to your project with our CLI.
